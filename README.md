Designed a sanctuary website for big cats. Where the user gives away their cats if they aren't able to take care of them anymore. Non-authorized users can see all the cats in the sanctuary however they aren't able to fill up the form to give away their cats unless they create an account. Once the authorized user creates an account they will be able to fill up the form to give away their cats. And once their form is approved by the admin they will be able to see all the cats in the sanctuary. After that, the admin checks what the cats need and according to that, they make changes to the database. The admin is also able to remove or edit the details of the cats on the database.
